Not sure if it&rsquo;s applicable in Indonesia.</p><p>Theorically, investing in an Index Fund is essentially investing in the nation&rsquo;s economy. This would be promising if the nation&rsquo;s policies and business atmosphere allows companies to bloom. Business atmosphere in Indonesia, in my opinion, is still controlled by the status-quo and not as &ldquo;fertile&rdquo; as The US. Also, currently there are no whole market index fund in Indonesia, and the lowest expense ratio of Indonesian index fund is at 1.5% (compared to sub 1% in The US). Those two things might not make index fund investing as profitable in Indonesia.</p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
